 test, but was entitled to incapacity benefit as suffering \'93from some specific disease \'85 and by reason of such disease \'85 there would be a substantial risk to [his] mental or physical health\'85if he was found capable of work\'94
 within the exception provided by regulation 27(b) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 (\'93the 1995 Regulations\'94). In 1996 the conditions in regulation 27 were recast and para
graph (b) was removed by the Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Miscellaneous) Regulations 1996 (\'93the 1996 Regulations\'94). The claimant did not fall within the exceptions as amended and his entitlement to incapacity benefit was terminated. 

\par Section 172 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 required the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to refer proposals for certain regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee unless \'85 (section 173(1)(b)) \'93
the [Committee] have agreed that they shall not be referred\'94
. Proposed amendments to regulations were referred informally to the Committee for them to decide whether they required a formal reference under section 172 or whether they agreed, under section 173, that the proposals should not be r
eferred. The Committee members were accustomed and expected to rely on the information and assistance of officials of the Department for Work and Pensions as to the detail and intended effects of any proposal put to them. The practice was for each propose
d amendment to be described by the departmental officials as \'93technical\'94, \'93neutral\'94, \'93adverse\'94 or \'93beneficial\'94. In 1996 when the proposal amendment of regulation 27 of the 1995 Regulations was submitted it was described as \'93
neutral\'94. At a subsequent meeting of the Committee to consider the proposals an official explained, in answer to questions about whether all the amendments were in fact \'93neutral\'94
, that all claimants who fell within regulation 27(b) of the 1995 Regulations would be covered by other provisions within the \'93all work test\'94
. Those statements were untrue. In reliance on them, the Committee did not require a formal reference of the proposed recasting of regulation 27 and the 1996 Regulations were made.
\par The claimant challenged the validity of regul
ation 27 as amended by the 1996 Regulations contending that he should continue to be given the benefit of regulation 27(b) of the 1995 Regulations as originally enacted. An appeal tribunal rejected his appeal against the termination of his benefit. He app
e
aled to the Commissioner who criticised the conduct of the departmental officials responsible for the misstatements but, in view of the concession that the agreement of the Committee was not procured by deception, concluded that the objective fact of that
 agreement was sufficient to comply with section 173(1)(b). The 1996 amendment of regulation 27 was therefore not invalid. On further appeal by the claimant to the Court of Appeal,

 argument that he should continue to be entitled to benefit by reason of a provision in regulation 27(b) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 (\'93the 1995 Regulations\'94

Mr Howker, who is in his late 50s, has for some years been suffering from heart trouble and other health problems. He received invalidity benefit from 1994. That benefit was replaced by incapacity benefit on 13 April 1995. The princ
ipal test for that benefit is what is known as the \'93all work test\'94
, a points-based test designed to determine whether someone is incapable of taking paid employment of some kind. Mr Howker was found not to satisfy that test. However, the 1995 Regulations c
ontained in regulation 27 a provision for entitlement to benefit in certain exceptional cases where the all work test was not satisfied. By regulation 27:

ges to regulation 27, that the explanation they gave was consistent with the reply which the Minister gave to the House of Lords and that on this assurance about the reasons for, and intentions of, the proposed amendment the Committee decided not to seek 
a formal reference.

On 28 January 1997 Mr Howker was examined for the purposes of the all work test and failed to attain the required points to qualify for benefit by that route. Under the new regulation 27 he did not qualify for exemption from satisfying t
hat test. His entitlement to benefit was terminated from 5 February 1997. It is accepted by him that the making of the 1996 Regulations was a change of circumstances justifying the review of his benefit.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 20.\tab}The Commissioner made the following findings in paragraph 34 of his decision:

(1) The Committee members were materially misled by what they were told by the departmental officials about the proposed amendment of regulation 27.  In particular they were misled by the statements made in Mr Axton\rquote s letter of 2
8 October 1996 and the explanatory memorandum on \'93Proposal 11: [neutral amendment]\'94
, telling them that the purpose and effect of the amendment was only to cope with the procedural consequences of transferring the decision on exemption from the all work test to an adjudication officer instead of a doctor in the wake of the decision in }{
\i ex parte Moule,}{ and that the changes were \'93neutral\'94 in their effect on claimants in that no existing entitlement under the regulation would be taken away.
\par (2) Those statements 
were untrue, and obviously so to anyone who looked at the old exempting conditions in conjunction with the new ones.  The decision to remove the old regulation 27(b) as a separate head of exemption cannot have been other than deliberate, to take away an e
xisting basis of entitlement actually being awarded on the opinion of the department\rquote s own doctors.
\par (3) Those statements were made by the departmental officials responsible for them with the intention that the Committee should act on them in deciding whethe
r or not to give their agreement that a reference and report on the proposed amendment was not necessary; and were made with a view to securing such agreement.
\par (4) The misleading impression given by the written statements was not corrected by any adequate explanation of the substance of the change to regulation 27 in the course of the meeting itself:  the reference to the removal of the \'93substantial risk\'94
 exempting condition recorded in the minute at paragraph 3.5 leaving the continuing, and misleading, imp
ression that any person whose entitlement currently arose by reason of that provision would instead continue to be entitled under some other provision of the redrafted regulations, and that all was related to the procedural changes necessary following the
 High Court decision.
\par (5) The Committee members with entire propriety and good faith accepted and acted on the misleading statements and assurances made to them, and gave their agreement on that basis.
\par (6) Finally, I consider it the proper inference to draw from the Committee\rquote s obvious concern as shown by minutes 3.4 and 3.5, the factual explanation given by Mr Smith\rquote 
s letter shortly after the event which I accept as accurate, and what in fact happened over proposal 26 (severe disablement allowance, the one amendment described to them as \'93adverse\'94
), that they would not have acted as they did if the amendment to regulation 27 removing the exempting condition of which most advantage had been taken by claimants had been correctly presented to them as the adverse
 amendment it was, but would then have required it to be the subject of a reference and report along with proposal 26; and I so find.\'94

p
pearing for the Secretary of State that a challenge to the validity of the new regulation 27 could not be entertained by the Commissioner after that regulation had received the express approval of both Houses of Parliament. That argument is not repeated b

hat the question whether regulation 27 is invalid turns on the true construction of the 1992 Act. It is to the enabling Act that one must look to see if any challenge to subordinate legislation is available (}{\i Boddington v. British Transport Police}{
 [1999] 2 
AC 143 at p. 160 per Lord Irvine of Lairg LC). The Lord Chancellor there recognised that there are situations in which Parliament may legislate to preclude a challenge, in the interest, for example, of providing certainty about the legitimacy of administr
ative acts on which the public may have to rely. He referred to two cases in which such challenges were held to be precluded:  }{\i R. v. Wicks}{ [1998] AC 92 and }{\i Quietlynn Ltd. v. Plymouth City Council}{
 [1988] 1 QB 114. But he said (at p. 161) that it was an impor
tant feature of both cases that they were concerned with administrative acts specifically directed at the defendants, where there had been clear and ample opportunity provided by the scheme of the relevant legislation for those defendants to challenge the
 
legality of those acts before being charged with an offence. He contrasted that with the case of subordinate legislation of a general character (in the sense that it is directed to the world at large) and where the first time an individual may be affected
 
by that legislation is when he was charged with an offence. In the present case Mr Drabble points to the fact that the new regulation 27 is of a general nature affecting all potential claimants and that Mr Howker in effect had no opportunity to challenge 
b
y way of judicial review the making of the regulations. When Mr Howker found that his benefit was terminated from a date only one month from the coming into force of the 1996 Regulations, he promptly challenged that decision in the manner permitted by the
 social security legislation.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 33.\tab}
It is not now in doubt that the question of whether the new regulation 27 was invalid was one which a Commissioner has jurisdiction to determine. That was made plain by the decision of the House of Lords in }{\i Chief Adjudication Officer v. Foster}{
 [1993] AC 754 [also reported as R(IS) 22/93], which held that a Commissioner could determine, whenever it was necessary to do so, whether a provision in regulations was beyond the scope of the enabling statute, and that it was not necessar
y to leave that to judicial review proceedings.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 34.\tab}The question then arises whether the relevant invalidity is limited in some way. As I have noted, Mr Sales relied on the }{\i City of Edinburgh}{
 case in both the Outer House and the Inner House of the Court of Session as supporting a test of invalidity only if the statutory instrument was patently defective. In my judgment that test cannot stand in the light of }{\i Foster}{ and }{\i Boddington}{
, however convenient administratively it would be to confine the permissible challenges to the validity of subordinate legislation. In }{\i Foster}{ Lord Bridge said that a commissioner\rquote 
s jurisdiction to determine whether a decision was erroneous in point of law encompassed deciding whether the decision of a social security appeal tribunal gave effect to secondary legislation which is }{\i ultra vires}{ in the sense of there being \'93
any errors of law referable to a misuse by the Secretary of State of his regulation-making power\'94 (see p. 762). Lord Bridge said (at p. 765) that if a Commissioner has jurisdi
ction to question the vires of secondary legislation the scope of that jurisdiction must, at least theoretically, embrace a challenge on the ground of irrationality as well as illegality. In }{\i Boddington}{
 it was held that distinctions between substantive and procedural invalidities were not justified. In }{\i Hoffmann-La Roche v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry}{
 [1975] AC 295 at p. 365 Lord Diplock said that the court had jurisdiction to declare invalid subordinate legislation approved pursuant to the affi
rmative resolution procedure if the Minister acted outwith the legislative powers conferred on him by the enabling statute and that was so whether the order was }{\i ultra vires}{
 by reason of its contents or by reason of the procedure followed prior to its being
 made. Thus despite the practical difficulties for a Commissioner in determining whether a regulation is invalid on any ground which might have allowed a challenge to its validity by way of judicial review, in my judgment he has the jurisdiction to make t
hat determination.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 35.\tab}
I come next to the question whether in the context of the statutory scheme what occurred in the present case rendered the making of regulation 27 by the Secretary of State invalid. Mr Drabble has concentrated attention on the role of the 
Committee in the statutory scheme and the part played by the Secretary of State through his officials in procuring the Committee\rquote 
s agreement, thereby enabling the regulation to be made. In my judgment it is clear that notwithstanding the fact that the Committee\rquote s role was, as its name implies, advisory, it was intended by the statutory scheme that the Committee\rquote 
s advice on the proposed regulations would be received by the Secretary of State and laid before Parliament unless the Committee agreed to no reference to it. This is emphasised by the mandatory requirement in section 172(1) that the Secretary of State 
\'93shall\'94 refer the proposals to the Committee and by the requirement, even in a case of urgency when the Secretary of State is empowered to dispense wit
h a reference, to refer the regulations so made to the Committee as soon as practicable after they are made, and the obligation on the Secretary of State to explain to Parliament, if he proposes not to give effect to the Committee\rquote 
s recommendations, his reasons why not. Plainly in the absence of the Committee\rquote s agreement Parliament was intended to have the benefit of the Committee\rquote s advice so as to be able to assess the new regulations.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 36.\tab}In that context the agreement of the Committee not to have a reference 
to it of proposed regulations assumes importance. Further, Parliament plainly intended that the agreement of the Committee should be an informed agreement, and the obligation under section 170(4) on the Secretary of State to provide such information as th
e
 Committee reasonably requires is equally plainly relevant, provided that the Committee has so required. In my judgment in the agreed practice to which I have referred in paragraph 13 above the Committee can be taken to have made a requirement for the pur
poses of section 170(4). As the Commissioner said in paragraph 15 of his decision of the officials of the Department providing information and assistance in relation to the detail and intended effect of a proposal:

ly on these officials to provide full, balanced and objective information without relevant points being withheld or obscured is in my judgment an entirely proper one, wholly consistent with the intention of section 170(4).  The Committee members should be
 able to rely implicitly and without question on the completeness of what they are told [by] those whose duty it is to assist them.  It is quite inconsistent with the scheme of Part XIII of the Act for it to be thought otherwise.\'94

nd, that the procedure intended by Parliament for the making of regulations has not been observed. That is so whether or not the officials acted innocently. There is nothing in the statutory provisions to suggest that Parliament would have intended so def
ective a procedure adopted by the Secretary of State, when matters were entirely under his control, to result in a valid regulation.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 38.\tab}I am not persuaded that the policy considerations advanced by Mr Sales require some other conclusion. I acknowledge the impo
rtance of clear and certain rules in this field, but it is no less important that statutory procedures should be duly observed if regulations are to be changed to deprive members of the public of benefits to which otherwise they were entitled. I accept th
a
t it is fundamental that there should be proper governmental and parliamentary control over the allocation of public monies. However, every member of the public adversely affected by a new regulation is entitled to challenge the lawfulness of that regulat
i
on on proper grounds. The courts have never shrunk from declaring the invalidity of a defective measure affecting the allocation of public monies. Parliament has already provided by section 27 of the Social Security Act 1998 that the effect of a determina
t
ion by a Commissioner or court that the decision of an adjudicating authority was erroneous in law should in specified circumstances be limited. Whether that section applies to the present circumstances was not the subject of argument before us, but it sh
o
ws that Parliament can make provision to limit the effect of a decision it considers adverse. I see the administrative inconvenience if delegated legislation can be challenged outside judicial review proceedings with their narrow time limits; but the rece
nt decisions of the House of Lords have made clear that such challenges are possible.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 39.\tab}As for the decisions in }{\i Frey}{, }{\i Asher }{and }{\i Norwest Holst}{
 on which Mr Howell relied, I cannot accept that they show that in the absence of bad faith in relation to the Committee\rquote 
s agreement there was due compliance with the statutory procedure. They were very different cases and do not go to that point. In }{\i Frey}{ what was sought to be impugned was the local authority\rquote 
s decision to refer certain tenancy agreements to the rent tribunal, and there was nothing to show that the decision, which did not affect the objectors\rquote  rights, was taken improperly. In }{\i Asher}{
, the decision of the Secretary of State to direct an extraordinary audit was sought to be challenged, and again this court held that the decision, which merely set machinery in motion, could not be impugned as bad faith was not alleged. In }{\i 
Norwest Holst}{ a decision by the Secretary of State to appoint inspectors of a company was held by this court not to be capable of challenge wh
ere the Secretary of State acted in good faith within his powers. In the present case it is not the agreement but the new regulation 27 which is challenged as invalid in circumstances where it is alleged that there has been a failure to comply with the re
quired statutory procedure.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 40.\tab}Nor can I accept Mr Howell\rquote 
s assertion that there is no rational basis for distinguishing between a misunderstanding by the Committee in agreeing to no reference as a result of incorrect information provided by the Secretary of S
tate and any other misunderstanding. In my judgment it is plain that the Secretary of State has a crucial role in the statutory scheme; when, in breach of his duty under section 170(4), incorrect information is provided to the Committee with the result th
at the Secretary of State and Parliament do not receive the Committee\rquote 
s advice which they would have received if correct information had been provided, that may well have consequences quite different from those where there has been a misunderstanding by the
 Committee for some other reason. I should make clear that I am not saying that the provision by the Secretary of State of any incorrect information will necessarily result in the invalidity of the consequent regulations. In each case an assessment has to
 be made of the significance of the failure. In the present case the Commissioner has made clear findings as to the consequences of what the Secretary of State, through his officials, did.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 41.\tab}As for the attempted comparison between the word \'93agreed\'94 in section
 172(1) and the same word in section 176(2), each must be construed in its own context. There is nothing comparable to section 170(4) in relation to the representative organisations to be consulted under section 176(2).
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 42.\tab}In the light of these conclusions, I
 cannot see that the factors relied on by Mr Sales (the fact that the new regulation 27 has operated since January 1997 and the Committee\rquote s and Parliament\rquote 
s acquiescence in what has occurred) should lead this court not to hold that the new regulation 27 is invalid. It is unfortunate that this case has taken so long to reach this court, but that is not the fault of Mr Howker.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 43.\tab}For these reasons I conclude that Mr Drabble is correct in his submissions that the new regulation 27 is invalid, and I respectfully disagree with the Commissioner
\rquote s conclusion. I suspect that the arguments before us have differed in emphasis from those presented to the Commissioner.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 44.\tab}In }{\i Ex parte Moule}{ Collins J. held that the old regulation 27 took effect with the deletion of the offending words \'93
in the opinion of a doctor approved by the Secretary of State.\'94  Mr Sales in his skeleton argument challenged whether a \'93blue pencil\'94 test could be performed. But before us he conceded that it could. It was not submitted that Mr Drabble was wrong
 in his submission that if the new regulation 27 was invalid, the old regulation 27(b) in the form modified by }{\i ex parte Moule}{ continued in operation, so that Mr Howker continues to be assessed under the old regime.

\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Pet
er Gibson LJ. Mr.Sales has rightly emphasised the important constitutional principle that it is for Parliament to determine how public money should be spent. Parliament has determined that we should have a system of social security benefits for those who 
a
re unable to provide for themselves. The broad outlines are laid down in legislation but the scheme is necessarily extremely complicated and requires frequent amendment to take account of social, economic and (as in this case) legal change. The details ha
v
e to be contained in delegated legislation. But Parliament has also recognised the need for both the Secretary of State and for Parliament to have independent and expert social policy advice before making changes to the scheme. There are complex questions
 
involved, about the definition of need, about equity between different groups, about the right kind of incentives, all in the context of very large numbers of people and very large sums of public money. In the context of a scheme whose fundamental purpose
 is to relieve \'93want\'94, the need for independent and expert advice is particularly clear when a change to the regulations might deprive a large number of existing claimants of their benefit.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 48.\tab}While the Secretary of State may refer such questions relating to t
he operation of any of the relevant enactments as he thinks fit to the Committee for their consideration and advice (section 170(3)), he has a positive duty to refer proposals to make regulations under any of the relevant enactments (section 172(1)), and 
t
o furnish the Committee with such information as the Committee may reasonably require for the proper discharge of their functions (section 170(4)). The volume of regulation is such that the Committee cannot possibly give detailed scrutiny to it all. Hence
 
proposals for new regulations do not have to be referred if the Committee have agreed that they shall not be referred' (section 173(1)(b)). Once referred, however, the Committee have a positive duty to consider them and make a report to the Secretary of S
t
ate (section 174(1)) and the Secretary of State has a positive duty to lay that report before Parliament with a copy of the regulations or draft regulations which he proposes to make. In doing so he must explain the extent to which he has given effect to 
t
he Committee's recommendations and, if he has not done so, why not (section 174(2)). This is a particularly precise set of obligations. It may be contrasted with the obligation in section 176, principally in relation to increases in housing benefit and co
u
ncil tax benefit, to consult with the relevant local government organisations unless they have agreed that this should not be done. The nature and purpose of consultation under section 176 is obviously rather different from the nature and purpose of consu
l
tation with the Social Security Advisory Committee. This is not surprising, as the Committee is a statutory body with a particular function under the Act. The difference is reflected in the lack of any duty on the Secretary of State to provide the local g
overnment organisations consulted with information, or upon them to report back to him, or upon him to inform Parliament of their views.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 49.\tab}The fundamental question in this case is whether it is open to the Secretary of State to lay draft regulations before Pa
rliament when his Department has misrepresented their effect to the Committee with the consequence that there is no report from the Committee to accompany them. There can be little doubt, as the Commissioner found, that had the proposal been properly pres
e
nted to the Committee they would have required it to be referred to them. There is no need to speculate on what would have happened next, but events would certainly have been different: either the Secretary of State would have withdrawn the proposal to th
i
nk again, as happened with another proposal submitted to the Committee at the same time; or he would have persisted and the Committee would have considered the matter and made a report; the report might have been favourable but it might well not have been
;
 the Secretary of State would then have thought about it and decided whether to withdraw the proposal or make changes to meet any concerns expressed by the Committee; and any eventual regulation laid before Parliament would have been accompanied by a repo
rt and explanation which made the position plain.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 50.\tab}
I understand the concern of the Committee when the argument was focussed so narrowly upon whether their agreement that the proposal should not be referred to them was valid. This raised the spectre of judici
al review of the Committee's decisions and actions, which the Committee was anxious to lay to rest. But the Court is not now being asked to declare that the Committee's agreement was a nullity: for one thing, that would take the appellant only part of the
 way. The Court is being asked to hold that the Secretary of State acted outside his powers in making the regulations when, for reasons within the control of his own department, the statutory procedure for doing so had not been properly followed.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 51.\tab}Most of th
e authorities which have been cited to us have been concerned with the issue of collateral challenge: in what circumstances can an individual affected by administrative action challenge its validity other than by any statutory processes laid down for doin
g so or by judicial review? The answer does of course lie in the proper construction, in the light of its purpose and context, of the statutory scheme in question. It is easy to see why the appellant in }{\i R v. Wicks}{
  [1998] AC 92 was not permitted to challeng
e the validity of an enforcement notice under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 in the course of criminal proceedings for failure to comply, given that there was not only a statutory procedure for appealing against such notices but also the possibili
ty of judicial review on any residuary ground which was not available in the statutory appeal. Equally it is easy to see why the appellant in }{\i Boddington v. British Transport Police}{
 [1999] 2 AC 143 had to be afforded the opportunity to challenge the validity of a bye-law banning smoking when he was prosecuted for breaking it. As the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, observed at p 161:

My Lords, in constitutional law a clear distinction can be drawn between an Act of Parliament and subordinate legislation, even though the latter is contained in an order made 
by statutory instrument approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament. Despite this indication that the majority of members of both Houses of the contemporary Parliament regard the order as being for the common weal, I entertain no doubt that the c

h as to render it invalid. Parliament laid down a very specific consultation process in sections 170 to 174 of the 1992 Act, the nature and purpose of which is obvious in the context of the social security scheme as a whole. Parliament must have intended 
that the Secretary of State comply with it, and comply with it properly, before making regulations: see the observations of Glidewell LJ and Sir John Donaldson MR in }{\i 
R v. Secretary of State for Social Services ex parte Cotton; R v. Secretary of State for Social Services ex parte Waite}{
, Court of Appeal, 14 December 1985. In that case, the Secretary of State had consulted the Committee but had not put draft regulations before them. Sir John Donaldson considered that the proposals were not sufficiently precise 
for this to be a proper consultation and would have held the resulting regulations invalid on that ground. Glidewell and May LJJ held that the Secretary of State had done enough to inform the Committee of what was proposed, although Glidewell LJ was conce
r
ned that although he had complied with the letter he had not complied with the spirit of the legislation. All three members of the court approached the case on the basis that a failure to comply with the consultation process could invalidate the regulatio
n.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 54.\tab}
In this case, there was clearly a failure to comply. The Committee had agreed a particular formula with the Department for classifying proposals so that they could decide whether or not to require a reference: this was information which they reasonably r
equired and the Department had agreed to supply to them. The information supplied in writing was seriously inaccurate, as was the explanation given at the meeting where the Committee considered this. The Commissioner left open the question of whether this
 
was deliberate. It was not necessary for him to find that it was. The officials had it within their power to give the Committee the correct information. They and through them the Secretary of State were responsible for the misinformation. The Secretary of
 State should not have made the regulation without putting it right. This was a material irregularity in the procedure laid down by Parliament and invalidates the regulation which resulted.
