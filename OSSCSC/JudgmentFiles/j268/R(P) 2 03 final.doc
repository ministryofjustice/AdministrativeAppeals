The claimant had been in receipt of a category A retirement pension for six years based on her own national insurance contributions when her husband reached the age of 65 in 1992.  He then claimed and received a category A pension. At
 that time the claimant could have claimed a category B pension based on his contributions, which would have been larger than her category A pension and payable in its place. She was not invited to make a claim then and in fact did not do so until March 2
0
00, when the pension was awarded, but only with effect from 2 December 1999. She appealed to an appeal tribunal, arguing that her claim should have been treated as a request for a correction to her existing pension, and that a claim was not necessary. The
 tribunal decided that it had no power to backdate the award beyond the three months provided for by regulation\~19 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (\'93the 1987 Regulations\'94

\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {The State pays two different kinds of retirement pension. These are called Category A and Category B. Basically the a
mount of a Category A pension is determined by the contributions the recipient has made over the whole of his or her working life. In the case of a Category B pension entitlement is based on marriage and the contributions of the other party to the marriag
e; the spouse must have reached retirement age and be entitled to a Category A pension. Sections 43 to 55 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\'93the 1992 Benefits Act\'94) provide for payment of these pensions.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 2.\tab}The present appeal is by
 the Secretary of State against the decision of Mr David Williams, a Social Security Commissioner, on 22 April 2002, allowing an appeal from the Bexleyheath appeal tribunal on 5 January 2001. It is made with the permission of Mr Williams, whose decision c
onflicts with an earlier decision of }{\i Wood}{ (CP/3/2001) by Mrs Deputy Commissioner Ramsay and, we were told, the current practice. Its outcome is of general importance to the Department as well as specific importance to the respondent.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 3.\tab}The respondent was 6
0 on 14 August 1986. She claimed and received a Category A pension on the basis of her own national insurance contributions. Because of the level of those contributions it was 34% of the maximum amount. Her husband, Mr Nelligan, was 65 on 20 October 1992.
 
He claimed and received a Category A pension from that time. The fact that Mr Nelligan reached the age of 65 triggered the right for the respondent to claim what could be described as a parasitic pension under Category B. The respondent could have made su
c
h a claim in 1992 and the standard procedure is, and was in 1992, to send someone such as Mr Nelligan a standard pack about 4 months before he reaches state pension age. The pack should have contained a second claim form for his wife to make a Category B 
claim should she choose to do so. It was accepted that for some reason no such pack was sent in this case. However, the Secretary of State\rquote 
s position is that he was under no legal obligation to send a pack and that it would be administratively impossible to
 notify everyone entitled to a retirement pension, hence the provision to which I shall come in a moment that anyone entitled to a benefit must claim it. The respondent did not make her claim until 1 March 2000 and it was treated as securing entitlement t
o benefit from 2 December 1999 (3 months before). This, according to regulation 19 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 S1 1987/1968 \'93the 1987 Regulations\'94) is the maximum period for which payment can be backdated.

s Category B pension was larger than her Category A pension. Her claim is that her Category B pension should have been backdated to 
1992 (when her husband was 65) rather than to December 1999. The Bexleyheath appeal tribunal dismissed her appeal on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to do as she wished because she did not claim the pension until March 2000. However, she appealed t
o the Social Security Commissioner who allowed her appeal.

The relevant statutory scheme is to be found in section 43 and following of the 1992 Benefits Act. Section 44 sets out the basic requirements for entitlement to a Category A pension. Section 48A 
sets out the basic requirements for entitlement to a Category B pension. However, these sections have also to be read in the context of section 1 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (\'93the 1992 Administration Act\'94) which provides:

 The proper context for the interpretation of section 43(5) is that of the section of which i
t forms part, noting the provisions that existed prior to the consolidation of those previous measures into the current section. As it is a section expressly designed to deal with conflicts between other sections, I do not find it of assistance to note th
o
se conflicts. Subsection (5) is a default provision that operates in cases where an individual has not given notice in writing of the kind which she is entitled to give from time to time under section 43(3). The effect of a notice is to choose which of th
e two pensions to which she is entitled the claimant wishes to receive. If notice is given, then subsection (4) provides that it is to have effect. If it is not, then subsection (5) operates.
\par 28.\tab  Subsection (3) is itself an exception to the rule in subsect
ion (2) if the claimant chooses to use it. A claimant does not have to give a notice under subsection (3). Subsection (2) allows an individual to receive both a Category A pension and a Category B pension at the same time, but makes provision (by referenc
e
 to section 73 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992) to remove any overlap caused by the double entitlement. Section 73 is brought into effect by the Social Security (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations 1979. The effect of subsection (2), read wit
h
 this regulation, is to stop an individual receiving more than the specified maximum amount of pension despite the double entitlement. Subsection (3) does not allow this capping to be sidestepped. It merely provides that the claimant could decide, say, to
 receive her Category B pension entitlement without reference to her Category A entitlement.
\par 29. \tab Subsection (5) is not drafted in limited terms. Nor was its predecessor in section 27(2). In my view, subsection (5) means what it says. [The respondent] was entitled from the date of her husband\rquote 
s claim to both a Category A pension and a Category B pension. Subsection (2) stopped her being entitled to more than the higher of them. Subsection (3) allowed her to choose whether she received the Category A pension 
topped up by  Category B entitlement or simply the Category B entitlement. As she did not make any option under subsection (3) the Secretary of State, under subsection (5), awarded her the Category B entitlement. Before that date, she also had given no no
tice and she had not made a claim. But she was entitled to the Category B pension if this was from time to time the most favourable to her whether she had claimed it or not.\'94

I read those final words as requiring, as a precondition of the operation of the rule in subsection (5), that the individual concerned must have clai
med one of the two relevant pensions but not both. It follows that subsection (5) recognises an entitlement to a pension for which no claim has been made in the limited circumstances in which the subsection applies. It is an express statutory exception to
 the general rule in section 1 of the (1992 Administration Act).\'94

In my judgment the Commissioner misunderstood the effect of section 43(5) and was wrong in his conclusion that it was an express statutory exception to the general rule in section 1 of th

 She met the necessary criteria but the insurance officer rejected her application because she had not made a claim before she reached pensionable age. The House of Lords rejected the insurance officer\rquote

 In order to reverse the effect of this decision Parliament enacted section 17 of the Social Security Act 1985, which added section 165A into the Social Security Act 
1975. That section was, so far as material, in the same terms as are now to be found in section 1 of the 1992 Administration Act. Thus, by enacting what is now section 1 of the 1992 Administration Act after the statutory predecessor to section 43(5) of th

rely on that Category A pension claim as a Category B pension claim when her husband does later reach retirement age. As Mr Forsdick for the appellant pointed out, if it was not necessary to make a claim for benefit these provisions would be unnecessary.

So, there cannot be two subsisting decisions in respect of the same claim. Also, there must be entitlement to each of two pensions, including a claim for each, before section 43 can bite on the situation.

t is where regulations provide that a claim for one benefit can be treated as a claim for a different benefit. The beneficiary is entitled to the most favourable benefit irrespective of a claim to that particular benefit. A practical example is where a wo
m
an does not claim a Category A pension at retirement age, but subsequently claims a Category B pension when her husband retires. Because Regulation 9 and Schedule 1 of the 1987 Regulations apply, her claim for a Category B pension can be treated as a clai
m
 for a Category A pension if this is more favourable to her. Under section 43(5) the Secretary of State, in the absence of notification from her, can pay the Category A pension even though that is not the pension that she has claimed. What is critical, ho
wever, is that the section 43(5) interchange can only operate after the conditions of entitlement, including the pre-condition under section 1 of the 1992 Administration Act of a claim or a deemed claim, have been met}{\i .}{
